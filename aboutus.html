                <p> Hi I'm little fox: <em>foxy</em></p>
                <p>Although he only has a cameo role, the fox is a super-duper important character in this book. He
                    teaches the prince lessons that the prince then teaches the narrator (and by extension us, the
                    readers.) Although he only has a cameo role, the fox is a super-duper important character in this
                    book. He teaches the prince lessons that the prince then teaches the narrator (and by extension us,
                    the readers.) </p>
                <p>The fox rescues the little prince from the despair he had fallen into on seeing a garden full of
                    roses on Earth—until that point, the prince had believed his flower (who was also a rose) when she
                    told him that she was the only one of her kind in the universe. </p>
                <p>But after the prince tames him, the fox tells him to go again to see the roses in the garden, and
                    that this time, the prince will see that his rose is indeed unique. </p>

                <p>The little prince’s home is a tiny asteroid named B-612, which is no bigger than a house.</p>
                <p>The little prince represents the open-mindedness of children.
                    He is a wanderer who restlessly asks questions and is willing
                    to engage the invisible, secret mysteries of the universe. The
                    novel suggests that such inquisitiveness is the key to understanding
                    and to happiness.</p>

                <p>I’m Xin Chen, an international student from China. Now it is my first year second semester of Master
                    of Informational Technology in University of Queensland. I finished my Bachelor of Commerce (major
                    in finance) in University of Western Australia. I enjoy taking photographs, making films, playing
                    guitar, watching films, and so on. The experiences of taking pictures and making films give me some
                    ideas of a good photo composition. Composition is the placing and arranging the visual elements in a
                    picture, which is similar to the visual organization of a web page. </p>
                <p>The website’s educational content is about mental health. Mental health is often ignored by people.
                    Many people do not seek help when they experience symptoms of mental illness, maybe because they
                    don’t know how to request for help, or they don’t even realize that they have mental health
                    problems. Therefore, I would use “The Little Prince” as the story theme for website to raise the
                    awareness for mental health. The website will provide a broad understanding of mental health to
                    users, introduce the main kinds of mental health problems, ways to request for help, tips to
                    maintain a good mental health and encourage people to seek help for mental health issues.</p>
