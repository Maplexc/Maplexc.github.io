                    <h3>Chapter 1 (At School)</h3>
                    <p>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from
                        Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of
                        swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing. </p>
                    <img class="chapter_pic" src="images\chapter 1.1.png">
                    <p>In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that
                        they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
                    </p>
                    <p>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored
                        pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like
                        this: </p>
                    <img class="chapter_pic" src="images\chapter 1.2.png">
                    <p>I went to school and showed my masterpiece to friends and teachers, and asked them whether the
                        drawing frightened them.</p>
                    <p>But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?" </p>
                    <p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an
                        elephant. But since the they were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew
                        the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the they could see it clearly. They always need to
                        have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this: </p>
                    <img class="chapter_pic" src="images\chapter 1.3.png">
                    <p>Their response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa
                        constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography,
                        history, arithmetic, and grammar. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number
                        One and my Drawing Number Two. </p>

                    <h3>Chapter 2 (Home)</h3>
                    <p>The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It
                        was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me. </p>
                    <p>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much
                        too complicated for me), he asked me: </p>
                    <p>"What is that object?"</p>
                    <p>"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane." </p>
                    <p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. </p>
                    <p>He cried out, then: </p>
                    <p>"What! You dropped down from the sky?" </p>
                    <p>"Yes," I answered, modestly.</p>
                    <p>"Oh! That is funny!"</p>
                    <p>And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like
                        my misfortunes to be taken seriously. </p>
                    <p>Then he added:</p>
                    <p>"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"</p>
                    <p>At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I
                        demanded, abruptly: </p>
                    <p>"Do you come from another planet?" </p>
                    <p>But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: </p>
                    <p>"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."</p>
                    <p>And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 3 (Social Relation)</h3>
                    <p>I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident
                        with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as
                        I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult
                        repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking
                        water to last a week. </p>
                    <p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I
                        was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can
                        imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said: </p>
                    <p>"What!"</p>
                    <p>"Draw me a sheep!"</p>
                    <p>Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my
                        drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.</p>
