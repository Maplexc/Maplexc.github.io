                <h1>Mental Relaxation</h1>
                <h3>Six steps to feel better by thinking straighter</h3>
                <p>In theory, how you perceive something largely determines how you will feel about it. If you have had
                    prolonged period of bad mood, it is by and large a result of how you think. Therefore, the way to
                    make yourself feel more reasonably is to rationalize your own thinking.</p>
                <h3>What you can do when you encounter a problem</h3>
                <h4>Step1: Deal with your feelings</h4>
                <p>Try to accept your feelings and explore the sources of stress and your unhappiness. It helps you feel
                    better. </p>
                <h4>Step2: Accept that you can cope with bad feelings</h4>
                <p>To "cope" means to manage; you are going to get over with it! Bad feelings do not last forever! </p>
                <h4>Step3: Reward your successes</h4>
                <p>You may break down life changes into smaller steps, and take them one at a time. You will have a
                    better chance of succeeding at each step...... </p>
                <h3>What you can do after the problem</h3>
                <h4>Step4: Try to identify your self-talk</h4>
                <p>Identify your self-talks and you can observe your reactions when you encounter a similar situation
                    again. </p>
                <h4>Step5: Analysis your self-talk</h4>
                <p>See if these common mistakes in thinking have appeared in your self-talks. </p>
                <h4>Step6: Teach yourself to think rationally</h4>
                <p>Turn irrational beliefs into rational ideas</p>

                <h3>Find a relaxation teacher</h3>
                <p>Yoga classes, meditation courses, or relaxation courses at community health centres or adult
                    education classes are all suitable to try.</p>
                <p>Some general physicians and psychologists offer individual physical relaxation training.</p>
                <p>There are plenty of commercial videos and cassettes on relaxation exercises. You can follow the
                    instructions and exercise at home.</p>
                <h3>Instant Relaxation</h3>
                <p>Step 1: Smile inwardly (that is, imagine yourself smiling, especially smile with your eyes)</p>
                <p>Step 2: Think: "Alert mind, calm body"</p>
                <p>Step 3: Take an easy, natural breath</p>
                <p>Step 4: While breathing out, relax your muscles (first your face, then shoulders, then feel the wave
                    of relaxation and warmth flows down to your toes.)</p>

                <h3>4 steps to good recreational habits</h3>
                <h4>Step 1: Access your present recreations</h4>
                <p>Record your present recreations with a small notebook. Write down what you do, how long you spend on
                    it, with whom you are sharing that activity and the pleasure you get from it. Keep an accurate
                    record day by day for at least a week or maybe longer.</p>
                <h4>Step 2: review your present recreations</h4>
                <p>Do your present recreations provide you with enough of the followings? </p>
                <img src="images\bebetter1.png">
                <h4>Step 3: plan your new recreations
                </h4>
                <p>If you have identified gaps or imbalances in your present recreation menu, you should make plans to
                    fill the gaps and correct the imbalances. Are you missing out on relaxation? How about refreshment?
                    What to add? You may find some ideas in newspapers and reports of local activities. Let your
                    imagination flow; you will find activities you would like to try.</p>
                <h4>Step 4: try out your new activities</h4>
                <p>It is possible to try a new recreation and not like it. Give yourself a pat on the back for trying,
                    drop it, and plan something else to replace it. Trying to do too much too quickly can just set you
                    up for failure which in turn leads to discouragement. You probably need to revise your plans from
                    time to time to accommodate changes in your interests, capacities and interpersonal relationships.
                    Try to satisfy your own needs according to the above-mentioned principles.</p>
